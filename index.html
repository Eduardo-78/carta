            <h3><b>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3></b>
       
            Dear Eileen,<br><br>

            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part <br>
            of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h3><b>Starting dates</b></h3><br>

                We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
                could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>

            Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
            You can find more information about <p style="color:blue;"> important university dates </p> on our website.</p><br>
        </p>

        <h3><b>Subjects of study</b></h3>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
            by are as follows, in order of priority:<br>

            <ol>
                <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li><br>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
                    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li><br>
                <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li><br>
            </ol>            
        
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how <br>
            long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and <br>
            anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br><br>
        </p>

           <h3><b>Exotic dance moves </b></h3><br>

            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances.<br>
            To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>

            <dl> 
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance </dt>
                <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village<br>
                    would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.
                </dd>

                <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle </dt>
                 <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br>
                     this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling <br>
                     their bodies around in impcrccptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students <br>
                     used to say that he thought this dance inspired modem styles such as Twerking.<br>
                </dd>

                <dt>Arctic robot dance </dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed <br>
                    to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being <br>
                    practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered <br>
                    that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
                </dd><br>
